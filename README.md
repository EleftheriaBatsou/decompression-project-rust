In this project, instead of using the flate2, I'm relying on the regular old "zip" in Rust, so that I can explore some more aspects of Rust.

This project is only for learning purposes.

### To run it:
```cargo run```
```cargo run 1com.zip``` // 1com.zip is the name of the file I want to decompress.
